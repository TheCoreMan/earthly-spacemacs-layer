# earthly-spacemacs-layer

Syntax highlight for Earthfiles in Spacemacs

## Plan

Write a syntax highlighter + auto-completion layer for Earthfiles for Spacemacs.

### Features (in order of importance)

- [ ] Syntax highlighting
- [ ] auto-completion (including target names)
- [ ] Built in pop-up docs
- [ ] Jump to target (bonus points for other files) with `SPC j`
- [ ] call target from within file `, e t` (, evaluate target) 
- [ ] maybe color successful targets/cached targets? Seems hard
